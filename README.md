# Turn Leo Varadkar into Leo Aardvark

A few days prior to the 2020 Irish General Election, a friend of mine pointed out that "Varadkar", the surname of our Taoiseach, who is an extremely polarising figure in Irish politics, is an anagram of the word "Aardvark". So, to lighten up the election process, and as a fun little task, I've created a Chrome extension that changes any instances of the word "Varadkar" on a webpage, into "Aardvark". So if you navigate to Leo's Wikipedia page, you will get to read all about the once leader of our country, Leo Aardvark.

You can add the extension to your browser by going here!
